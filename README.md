# Kilonizer
------------
This project aims to bring together freelance developers and companies.

## Original Problem
We are looking for a way to make companies hire more freelancers while cutting down on transfer fees.

## Our Solution
A trustworthy platform allowing companies to save on fees when hiring freelance developers, while increasing the trust between both parties. It's also a good way for both parties to earn more money by using our Escrow solution.

### Technical Challenges
-------------------------
We had to create the Escrow smart contract as well as the frontend interface for freelancers.

### Difficulties Encountered
We had some difficulties setting up the smart contract but finally managed it after a while. We still haven't managed to connect the frontend interface with our smart contracts.

### Conclusion
Despite the difficulties encountered during the hackathon due to our lack of Web3/Frontend development experience, this moment was incredible. We enjoyed the challenge of working on new technologies while meeting really nice people, all in a really nice place.

#### Thank you for the opportunity
